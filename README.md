# Pollution_Analysis_of_Beijing_City

This project aims to analyze and predict air pollution levels in Beijing using machine learning algorithms, specifically k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Linear Regression. Pollution, particularly PM2.5 levels, poses a significant health risk in urban areas, and understanding its patterns and predictors is crucial for effective policy-making and public health efforts. By leveraging historical data, including pollutant levels and meteorological features, this project attempts to forecast pollution concentrations at various sites across Beijing. The dataset used includes a range of features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, which serve as indicators of pollution fluctuations across different times and locations in the city.

The data preprocessing step involved examining the structure and relevance of each feature, discarding those that were not useful, and encoding categorical variables into numerical values. The feature engineering process ensured that only relevant meteorological data influenced the predictions, excluding pollution readings from other sites to avoid data leakage. This careful data preparation helped to maintain the integrity of the predictive models, focusing on the true patterns of pollution variation rather than artificially inflated correlations.

Two machine learning models, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Linear Regression, were applied to predict PM2.5 levels. kNN, a non-parametric algorithm, was selected due to its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships, as it makes predictions based on the similarity of instances. Linear Regression, on the other hand, was included for its simplicity and interpretability, making it easier to understand how each meteorological factor contributes to pollution levels. Both models were trained on separate subsets of the data corresponding to different sites, and hyperparameter tuning was applied, especially for kNN, to optimize the number of neighbors for better accuracy.

To evaluate the models' performance, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and RÂ² scores were calculated, providing insights into the accuracy and explanatory power of each model. The results indicated that each model had unique strengths; Linear Regression provided a straightforward relationship between features and pollution levels, while kNN excelled in capturing more nuanced patterns that the linear model could not. However, due to its sensitivity to hyperparameters and potential for overfitting, kNN required careful tuning to achieve optimal results.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in environmental monitoring by using predictive models to analyze pollution patterns in Beijing. The comparison between kNN and Linear Regression highlights the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability, providing valuable insights for future research and real-world applications. By applying these models to urban pollution data, the study showcases how data-driven approaches can contribute to understanding and potentially mitigating the impacts of air pollution in densely populated cities.
